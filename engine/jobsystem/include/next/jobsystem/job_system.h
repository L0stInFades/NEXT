/**
 * @brief Thread pool-based job execution system
 *
 * Provides asynchronous task execution with dependency tracking,
 * priority scheduling, and work stealing capabilities.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Multi-threaded job execution with configurable worker count
 * - Job dependencies (jobs wait for dependencies before executing)
 * - Priority levels (High, Normal, Low)
 * - Job cancellation
 * - Main-thread cooperative execution (Pump)
 * - Performance statistics
 *
 * Usage:
 *   JobSystem::Instance().Initialize();
 *   auto job = JobSystem::Instance().Submit([] {
 *       // Do work
 *   });
 *   JobSystem::Instance().Wait(job);
 *   JobSystem::Instance().Shutdown();
